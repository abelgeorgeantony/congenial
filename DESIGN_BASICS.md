# Idea:
A Television like user-experience.
Posts by users will be streamed like how a TV channel stream's shows. Users can
also search and view content.



# Things I wish to implement:
1) Highly customisable profile for each user
2) Advanced post/content interacting/creating mechanism
3) Reduced data usage(sending and receiving bit encoded data instead of bloated things like JSON).
